## Technical Architecture

EchoRemind is built with modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
- **UI Components**: Custom-built components with React Native
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with file-based routing
- **Theming**: Dynamic theme system with light/dark mode support

### Simulated Features

In this demo version, the following features are simulated:

- **Voice Recognition**: In a production app, this would use Google's Speech-to-Text API or OpenAI's Whisper API
- **AI Processing**: Natural language processing is simulated; a production version would use NLP libraries or custom ML models
- **Cloud Sync**: Data persistence is local only; production would use Firebase or a similar service
- **Push Notifications**: Local notifications are simulated; production would use Expo's notification system
